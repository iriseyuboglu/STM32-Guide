# STM32-Guide

Hello! This (unfinished) repo will try to give you a basic introduction to STM32 programming for our team.

- This [STM 32 Project Configuration Guide](STM32-Project-Configuration-Guide.md) will give you the basics on how to configure a project and adjust some settings before starting to code. You can refer to it in any kind of project.

(This [STM32xxxxxxxx_FLASH.ld file correction](STM32xxxxxxxx_FLASH.ld%20file%20correction) will give you the correct ld file, if it is not resolved my STM32CubeMX by the new update, but it should be!)

After this, you are recommended to follow some tutorials over the internet, try to replicate them in your code on different projects and then flash your work on the actual boards in toolbox.

The first tutorial playlist to start with is [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNyfXcjhOAwO5HNTKpZPsqBhelLF2rWQx&si=JP6wjN-cqGAb2lGn).

The rest of the repo will be filled with small tutorials and notes like this:
- [Ex: Blinking LED](Ex-Blinking-LED.md)

- [Quick Introduction To Terms](IntroToTerms.md)

Good luck, may the Flash Release be with you!
