# STM32-Guide

Hello! This (unfinished) repo will try to give you a basic introduction to STM32 programming for our team.

- [STM 32 Project Configuration Guide](STM32-Project-Configuration-Guide.md) gives you how to configure a project, and adjust some settings before starting to code, you can refer to it in any kind of project. ([STM32xxxxxxxx_FLASH.ld file correction](STM32xxxxxxxx_FLASH.ld%20file%20correction) gives you the correct ld file, if it is not resolved my STM32CubeMX by the new update)

After this, you are recommended to follow some tutorials over the internet, try to replicate it in your code on different projects and then flash it on the actual board.

The first tutorial playlist to start with is [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNyfXcjhOAwO5HNTKpZPsqBhelLF2rWQx&si=JP6wjN-cqGAb2lGn).

The rest of the repo will be filled with small tutorials and notes like this, but nowhere near an actual tutorial:
- [Ex: Blinking LED](Ex-Blinking-LED.md)

- [Quick Introduction To Terms](IntroToTerms.md)
